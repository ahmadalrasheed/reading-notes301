### SQL vs NoSQL: High-Level Differences
 ![](https://techskill.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SQL-server.jpg)
* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
* SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

*  SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
* SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
* For complex queries: SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.


### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
tables

#### Example:

**MySQL Community Edition**

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?


 ***NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.***


#### Example.
**Hbase**

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
**NoSQL**

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

**SQL databases**

### What does SQL stand for?
structred query language

### What is a realational database?
MYSQL database its a database consists of tables and the are connected with each other by primary key
